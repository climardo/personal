# Hank’s 30th Birthday
**Date**: Saturday, March 26, 2022  
**Time**: ~4:30PM  
**Location**: [Jack’s Goalline Stand-Fair Haven](https://www.jacksgoallinestand.com/locations/fair-haven/) (New Location)  
[583 River Road, Fair Haven, New Jersey](https://goo.gl/maps/zVMKNKx2zuC1fgEP9)  

**Game plan**:  
The New Jack’s is BYOB at the moment and the Elite 8 Games from the tournament will be on. Just a spot that has room and food to order and we bring the drinks so I think it’s good. Only downfall is they close around 8-9PM right now since it’s New. After we all hang out anything else is possible to continue the night but no other solid plans atm.

**Please RSVP to me by Wednesday the 23rd** so I can have a head count. I don’t expect everyone to make it all. If you can cool, if you can’t cool.
